We would greatly appriciate your feedback on that and on the other new features. Basic information for the new production user interface and system can be found on the Production page in our ingame help (question mark icon). Please note that our ingame help as well as the tutorial are at the moment still work in progress. Please report your feedback, found issues and bugs that you experience during your play on Steam or in our Redmine bug tracking system: https://redmine.thqnordic.com/projects/the-guild-3-early-access. Crash dumps for bug reports can be found in the folder \"C:\\Users\\[USERNAME]\\AppData\\Local\\Guild3\\sentry\\reports\". Thank you in advance!\n\nYou can always find the latest patch notes on our webpage https://theguildgame.com !\n\nThis version includes texts for the following languages: English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Russian, Korean, Chinese and Japanese.\nNote: We are regularly updating the game during early access. That's why you may find texts which are not yet translated in your language. Please note that of course all the texts will be fully translated when the game is leaving early access.\n\nImportant information\nThe game does not display/load save games from outdated patch versions as they have become incompatible due to the rework of core systems.\n\nIf you are experiencing difficulties with loading and saving the game, you may attempt to delete all files from the folder \"c:\\Users\\[USERNAME]\\Saved Games\\Guild3\" (standard under Windows).\n\nMultiplayer: If you have a restrictive firewall then you may have to manually open the following outgoing ports to be able to play in multiplayer: 61111 TCP & UDP, 36895 TCP & UDP, 36975 TCP & UDP.\n\nIt is quite possible that some problems that you have in your game are caused by missing or corrupted files. In this case, please use the verification and/or repair functionality of Steam or GOG.\n\nIf you still have issues afterwards, then we recommend to uninstall the game and then manually delete the folder \"C:\\Users\\[USERNAME]\\AppData\\Local\\Guild3\" (or \"C:\\Users\\[USERNAME]\\Documents\\Guild3\"). Then re-install the game. ";
